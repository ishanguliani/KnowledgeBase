All important lessons to learn github usage can be found here!

The following is the basic funda of working with a repository on github:-

1. *ADD* FILE TO INDEX IN LOCAL REPOSITORY(Command : git add . )
2. *COMMIT* THE CHANGES TO THE INDEX IN LOCAL REPOSITORY(Command : git commit )
3. *PUSH* THE LOCAL REPOSITORY TO THE REMOTE REPOSITORY(git push origin master)

NOTE : git push actually implies git push <TO> <FROM> and somehow it turns out that the REMOTE repository that exists at http://github.com/<username>/<repository-name> is called the ORIGIN. Whereas the LOCAL Repository insode which we are working on our machines is called the MASTER.
